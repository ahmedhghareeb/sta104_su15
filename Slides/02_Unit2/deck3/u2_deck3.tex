\subsection{Discrete \& continuous probability distributions}
\label{mi1normal}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Discrete \& continuous probability distributions}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{discrete probability distribution} lists all possible events and the probabilities with which they occur
\begin{itemize}
\item The events listed must be disjoint
\item Each probability must be between 0 and 1 
\item The probabilities must total 1
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item A \hl{continuous probability distribution} differs from a discrete probability distribution in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability that a continuous random variable will equal to any specific value is zero.
\item As such, they cannot be expressed in tabular form.
\item Instead, we use an equation or a formula to describe its distribution via a probability density function (pdf).
\item We can calculate the probability for ranges of values the random variable takes (area under the curve).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}
\label{mi3normal}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}

\[ Z = \frac{obs - mean}{SD} \]

\begin{itemize}

\item Z score: number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean

\pause

\item Defined for distributions of any shape, but only when the distribution is normal can we use Z scores to calculate percentiles

\pause

\item A Z score creates a common scale so you can assess data without worrying about the specific units in which it was measured.

\pause

\item Observations with $|Z| > 2$ are usually considered \hl{unusual}.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Z distribution is normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$}
\label{mi4normal}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{4. Z distribution is normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$}

\begin{itemize}

\item Linear transformations of a normally distributed random variable will also be normally distributed.

\[

\]
and
\[
Y = a + b X,

then
\[

\subsection{Normally distributed data plot as a straight line on the normal probability plot}
\label{mi5normal}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anatomy of a normal probability plot}

\begin{itemize}

\item Data are plotted on the y-axis of a normal probability plot, and theoretical quantiles (following a normal distribution) on the x-axis

\pause

\item If there is a linear relationship between the data and the theoretical quantiles, then the data follow a nearly normal distribution

\pause

\item Since a linear relationship would appear as a straight line on a scatter plot, the closer the points are to a perfect straight line, the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model

\pause

\item Constructing a normal probability plot requires calculating percentiles and corresponding Z-scores for each observation, which is tedious. Therefore we generally rely on software when making these plots
