\subsection{Use hypothesis tests to make decisions about population parameters}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Use hypothesis tests to make decisions about population parameters}

Hypothesis testing framework:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses.

\item Check assumptions and conditions.

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value.

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question.

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis testing for a population mean}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses
\begin{itemize}
\item $H_0: \mu = null~value$
\item $H_A: \mu <$ or $>$ or $\ne null~value$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Check assumptions and conditions
\begin{itemize}
\item Independence: random sample/assignment, 10\% condition when sampling without replacement
\item Sample size / skew: $n \ge 30$ (or larger if sample is skewed), no extreme skew
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value (draw a picture!)
\[ Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE},~where~SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

\pause

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question
\begin{itemize}
\item If p-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_0$, data provide evidence for $H_A$
\item If p-value $> \alpha$, do not reject $H_0$, data do not provide evidence for $H_A$

$\:$ \\

\pause

\item  \textcolor{gray}{A high p-value confirms the null hypothesis.}\\

\pause

In order to calculate $P(\bar{X} > 1.4~mil)$, we need to first determine the distribution of $\bar{X}$. According to the CLT,

\pause

\[ \bar{X} \pause \sim N \pause \left( mean = 1.3, \pause SE = \frac{0.3}{\sqrt{60}} = 0.0387 \right) \]

\pause

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\bar{X} > 1.4 ) &=& P\left(Z > \frac{1.4 - 1.3}{0.0387}\right) \\
\pause
&=& P(Z > 2.58) \\
\pause
&=& 1 - 0.9951 \pause =  0.0049
