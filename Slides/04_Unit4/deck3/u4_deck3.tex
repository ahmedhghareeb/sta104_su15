\frametitle{2. ANOVA is useful for testing if there is \emph{some} difference
between the means of many different groups.}

Null hypothesis for $F$-test (the test associated with ANOVA):
\[ H_0: \mu_{\textmd{placebo}} = \mu_{\textmd{purple}} = \mu_{\textmd{brown}} =
\ldots = \mu_{\textmd{peach}} = \mu_{\textmd{orange}} \]

\clicker{Which of the following is a correct version of the alternative
hypothesis?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item For any two groups, including the placebo group, no two group means are the same.
\item For any two groups, not including the placebo group, no two group means are the
same.
\item Amongst the jelly bean groups, there are at least two groups that have different group means.
\item \solnMult{Amongst all groups, there are at least two groups that have different group means.}

The practical implication of this alternative is: ``At least one color of
jelly bean is linked to acne.''

\frametitle{3. The F-test is based on comparing between group to within group variation}

For historical reasons, we use a modification of this ratio called the $F$-statistic
\[ F = \frac{\sum {\color{blue} \mid}^2 ~ / ~ (k - 1)}{\sum {\color{green} \mid}^2 ~ / ~ (n - k)} ~ =  ~ \frac{MSG}{MSE} \]
where $k$ is the \# of groups and $n$ is the \# of observations
