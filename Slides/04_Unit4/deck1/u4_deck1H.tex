\item PS3 due tonight

\item Project proposals due Thursday night

\item MT corrections extra credit: Work \textbf{as a team} to write up a collective exam corrections document that discusses all questions missed by any member of the team. Your corrections should show full work and explain reasoning, even for the multiple choice questions. Due by the end of the day on Wednesday, June 3. \textbf{Extra credit:} +2 points on the exam.
