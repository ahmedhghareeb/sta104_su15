\begin{itemize}

\item An alternative approach to constructing confidence intervals is \hl{bootstrapping}. 

\pause

\item This term comes from the phrase ``pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps", which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without any outside help. 

\pause

\item In this case the \sout{im}possible task is estimating a population parameter, and we'll accomplish it using data from only the given sample.

\frametitle{Bootstrapping}

\begin{itemize}

\item Bootstrapping works as follows:
\pause
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the original sample, of the same size as the original sample
\pause
\item calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, proportion, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples
\pause
\item repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - a distribution of bootstrap statistics
\end{enumerate}

\pause

\item The XX\% bootstrap confidence interval can be estimated by
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item the cutoff values for the middle XX\% of the bootstrap distribution,
\item[]
\pause
\item[] OR
\item[]
\pause
\item $\bar{x}_{boot} \pm z^\star SE_{boot}$
