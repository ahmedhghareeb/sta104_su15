\frametitle{Bootstrapping}

\begin{itemize}

\item An alternative approach to constructing confidence intervals is \hl{bootstrapping}. 

\pause

\item This term comes from the phrase ``pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps", which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without any outside help. 

\pause

\item In this case the \sout{im}possible task is estimating a population parameter, and we'll accomplish it using data from only the given sample.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bootstrapping}

\begin{itemize}

\item Bootstrapping works as follows:
\pause
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the original sample, of the same size as the original sample
\pause
\item calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, proportion, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples
\pause
\item repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - a distribution of bootstrap statistics
\end{enumerate}

\pause

\item The XX\% bootstrap confidence interval can be estimated by
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item the cutoff values for the middle XX\% of the bootstrap distribution,
\item[]
\pause
\item[] OR
\item[]
\pause
\item $\bar{x}_{boot} \pm z^\star SE_{boot}$

\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. When comparing means of two groups, ask if paired or independent}

\begin{itemize}

\item dependent (paired) groups (e.g. pre/post weights of subjects in a weight loss study, twin studies, etc.)
\[ SE_{\bar{x}_{diff}} = \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n_{diff}}} \]

\item independent groups (e.g. grades of students across two sections)
\[ SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } \]

\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

- Go through some examples of where you have two groups.
  - Twin studies for instance.

- Overall SE increases when looking at two different groups.

- Lemonade and cup.  Uncertainty in both.  Makes uncertainty in difference
greater.

- Comment on types of data.

\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. T corrects for uncertainty introduced by plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$}

\begin{itemize}

\item Essential when $n$ is small ($n < 30$) since $s$ is more likely to be not be a good estimate for $\sigma$ when $n$ is small than when $n$ is large

\pause

\item Could be used when $n$ is large as well

\pause

\item Also has a bell shape, but its tails are \hl{thicker} than the normal model's
\begin{itemize}
\item Observations are more likely to fall beyond two SDs from the mean than under the normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Extra thick tails are helpful for mitigating the effect of a less reliable estimate for the standard error of the sampling distribution (since $n$ is small)

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}

- Corrects for certainty when plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$.
