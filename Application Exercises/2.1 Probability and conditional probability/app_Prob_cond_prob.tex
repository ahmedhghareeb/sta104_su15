The following table shows the distribution of class year and whether or not students voted in the last presidential election for 176 Sta 101 students. \\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr|r}
  \hline
 & no, eligible but didn't & no, not eligible & yes & total \\ 
  \hline
first-year & 3 & 38 & 3 & 44 \\ 
  sophomore & 10 & 40 & 14 & 64 \\ 
  junior & 7 & 6 & 41 & 54 \\ 
  senior & 4 & 1 & 9 & 14 \\ 
  \hline
  total & 24 & 85 & 67 & 176 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Answer the following questions based on these data. Make sure to show all your work. \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item  What is the probability that a randomly chosen student has voted in the last presidential election?

\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen student is a junior \underline{and} has voted in the last presidential election?

\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen student is a junior \underline{given that} s/he has voted in the last presidential election?

\item Categorize the three probabilities you calculated above as marginal, conditional, or joint.

\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen student is a junior \underline{or} has voted in the last presidential election?

\item What percent of students are junior \underline{or} have voted in the last presidential election?

\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen student has voted \underline{given that} s/he is a first year? What about sophomore, junior, and senior?

\item Do these data suggest an association between class year and whether or not students have voted in the last presidential election? Explain your reasoning in one or two sentences.

\end{enumerate}
