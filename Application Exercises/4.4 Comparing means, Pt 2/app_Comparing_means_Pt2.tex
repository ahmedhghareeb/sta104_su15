Since 2005, the American Community Survey polls $\sim$3.5 million households yearly. The following summarizes distribution of salaries of males and females from a random sample of individuals who responded to the 2012 ACS:

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
			& $\bar{x}$ 	& $s$	& $n$ \\
\hline
male			& 55,890		& 68,767.88	& 470 \\
female		& 29,240		& 32,025.98	& 373 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}

We want to evaluate whether salaries of men and women are different, on average.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Define the parameter of interest and the point estimate and calculate the point estimate.

\item Conduct a hypothesis test answering the research question. Don't forget to check conditions first. Use $\alpha = 0.10$. Make sure to frame your conclusion in context of the data and the research question.

\item Calculate a confidence interval for the parameter of interest at the confidence level equivalent to the previous hypothesis test. Make sure to interpret the interval in context of the research question.

\end{enumerate}
