Dr. \c{C}etinkaya-Rundel \hfill Data Analysis and Statistical Inference \\

\ttl{Application exercise \appno{}: \\
Inference for a mean - mechanics}

\inst{Submit your responses on \Sakai{}, under the appropriate assignment. Only one submission per team is required. One team will be randomly selected and their responses will be discussed.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You are given the following hypotheses: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] $H_0: \mu = 34$
\item[] $H_A: \mu > 34$
\end{itemize}
We know that the sample standard deviation is 10 and the sample size is 65. For what sample mean would the p-value be equal to 0.05? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.
