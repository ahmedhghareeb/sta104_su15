\section*{How many digits of $\pi$ do Americans have memorized?}

A Survey Monkey Audience poll asked 941 respondents to type the digits of $\pi$ from memory. The distribution of results is as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | r}
LEVEL OF  &	PERCENTAGE  \\
PRECISION & OF RESPONDENTS \\
\hline
3.1		& 73 \\
3.14		& 64 \\
\textbf{3.141}	& \textbf{33} \\
3.1415	& 26 \\
3.14159	& 19 \\
3.141592	& 12 \\
3.1415926    &	10 \\
3.14159265  &	7 \\
3.141592653 & 	5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Survey Monkey says that their Audience surveys are benchmarked to ensure the polling pool is representative of the U.S. population.

Don't forget to check the conditions when completing the following tasks.

\begin{enumerate}

\item You are asked to write a newspaper article about the percentage of people who have memorized digits of $\pi$ beyond the second decimal (third decimal or more). You, obviously, shouldn't just report the point estimate from the survey, but instead also provide a margin of error around it. Report the findings in one sentence at the 95\% confidence level.

\item Evaluate whether these data provide convincing evidence that less than 50\% of people have memorized digits of $\pi$ beyond the second decimal.

\end{enumerate}
