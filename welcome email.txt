Hi everyone,

Wednesday, May 13, is our first class. You will receive a WebEx link to join the meeting before the course starts. Please make sure to "arrive" on time.

In order to get some information on your stats background to help place you in teams you will need to complete two items by 5pm on Sunday, May 10:
    - Getting to know you survey: Complete on Sakai, under Tests & Quizzes, direct link: https://sakai.duke.edu/samigo-app/servlet/Login?id=6fa7ebf3-01af-42a6-91ba-3e813d3901221431052723743
    - Pretest: Multiple choice pretest at https://apps3.cehd.umn.edu/artist/user/scale_select.html using the following access code: IBO9952MFH. Your score won't factor into your course grade, but you should still take it seriously and try your best.

Resources for Unit 1 are linked via https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Summer15/sta104.01-1/resources/. You should watch the videos for Unit 1 guided by the learning objectives. You can also read the textbook at https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os. We have a readiness assessment on Wednesday - you should do your best to prepare even though it's just for practice (not graded).

Slides for Wednesday's class will be available at the time of the class (and will also be posted on the course webpage).

I would strongly recommend that you wear headphones during the class as the audio quality is much better with headphones. Also, make sure that you're muted at times when you're just listening. I'm sure there will be a few hiccups but we'll work through those during the first couple sessions.

See you soon!

Best,
Dr. Cetinkaya-Rundel
